push 0    ; Push 0 onto the stack
push 1    ; Push 1 onto the stack
push 2    ; Push 2 onto the stack
push 3    ; Push 3 onto the stack
pall      ; Print the entire stack

push hola ; Push 'hola' onto the stack (assuming 'hola' is a string)

push 5    ; Push 5 onto the stack
push 6    ; Push 6 onto the stack
pall      ; Print the entire stack

; This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!
